/**
 * UTC timestamp (seconds) for `hour`:00 local wall-clock time on the

 *
 * FIX: an earlier version of this file computed one shared "day start"
 * instant anchored to CHART_TIME_ZONE, then tried to reach each
 * session's own hour by adding `hour * 3600000` to that anchor before
 * asking what the SESSION's zone read there. That only works if the
 * anchor is itself UTC midnight - adding "9 hours" to a Berlin-midnight
 * instant and then asking what Tokyo's clock reads at that point mixes
 * two unrelated zones' arithmetic. Verified against real dates: it put
 * Tokyo's session two hours early (Berlin's own UTC+2 leaking in) in
 * summer. This version avoids the problem entirely by resolving the
 * year/month/day parts once (in CHART_TIME_ZONE, which just tells us
 * *which* calendar date to use) and then converting that date's hour
 * straight into UTC using each session's OWN zone, independently, with
 * no shared numeric anchor between zones at all.
 *
 * Two-pass: guess the UTC instant assuming the zone's offset were zero,
 * read that zone's REAL offset at roughly that instant, then apply it.
 * One pass is enough here because every session's start/end hour used
 * above falls in the middle of a normal working day, nowhere near the
 * one or two clock-hours a year where a region is actually mid-DST-jump.
